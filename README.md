# Capstone Requirements

### Technical Requirements:
- React
- Django Rest Framework
- Once you have reached MVP: Deployed Site (Firebase, Heroku, and/or Netlify)

### Planning:
- Use Github Projects for planning with issue tickets and a project board
- Create wireframes (use whatever tool you want - moqups, lucid charts, photoshop, adobe XD, Figma, etc.)
- Create an ERD
- If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your mentor will not let you code.

### Documentation:
- Create a readme that shows another dev how to pull down your code and get it running. The bangazon readme is a good example of this

### These ideas will get rejected:
- No video games
- No magic mirror
- Projects shouldn't be for someone who will pay you
- No projects that are super similar to things we have done in class


### Due Dates
- Initial proposal: September 8th requirements found [here](./proposal_requirements.md)
    - Once the proposal is filled out send it to your mentor for review 
- ERD, Wireframes, and Issue tickets: September 10th (Don't wait till the 10th to turn everything in! The sooner everything is approved the sooner you can start coding)
    - Once you have all of this finished, schedule a 1-1 with your mentor to get final approval
- MVP/Soft Demo: September 23th
- Demo Day: September 24th

### Along the way
We will have stand up's twice a day, in the morning in-person and after lunch using slack
