# Capstone Requirements

### Technical Requirements:
- React
- Django Rest Framework
- Deployed Site (Firebase and/or Heroku)

### Planning:
- Use Github Projects for planning with issue tickets and a project board
- Create wireframes (use whatever tool you want - moqups, lucid charts, photoshop, adobe XD, Figma, etc.)
- Create an ERD
- If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your manager will not let you code.

### Documentation:
- Create a readme that shows a dev how to pull down your code and get it running. The bangazon readme is a good example of this

### These ideas will get rejected:
- Projects shouldn't be something for your day job
- Projects shouldn't be for someone who will pay you
- No games
- No projects that are super similar to things we have done in class


### Due Dates
- Initial proposal: February 27th requirements found [here](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-12/Capstone-Requirements/blob/main/proposal_requirements.md)
- ERD and Issue tickets: March 6th
- Wireframes: March 9th
- MVP: March 23
- Demo Day: March 25th 

### Along the way
We'll have stand ups at the start of each class to check in with what you're working on and any blockers you have
