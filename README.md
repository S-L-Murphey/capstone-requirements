# Capstone Requirements

### Technical Requirements:
- React
- Django Rest Framework
- Deployed Site (Firebase and/or Heroku)

### Planning:
- Use Github Projects for planning with issue tickets and a project board
- Create wireframes (use whatever tool you want - moqups, lucid charts, photoshop, adobe XD, Figma, etc.)
- Create an ERD
- If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your manager will not let you code.

### Documentation:
- Create a readme that shows another dev how to pull down your code and get it running. The bangazon readme is a good example of this

### These ideas will get rejected:
- No games
- Projects shouldn't be for someone who will pay you
- No projects that are super similar to things we have done in class


### Due Dates
- Initial proposal: June 8th requirements found [here](https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-46/CAPSTONE-INFORMATION/blob/main/02-initial-capstone-proposals.md)
- ERD, Wireframes, and Issue tickets: June 1th (Don't wait till the 11th to turn everything in! The sooner everything is approved the sooner you can start coding) 
- MVP/Soft Demo: June 24th
- Demo Day: June 25th 

### Along the way
There will be a stand up form to fill out every morning and a in-video stand up in the afternoon to make sure you don't stay blocked for too long
